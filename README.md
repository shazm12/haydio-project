# ** Haydio**

A cool fun radio for your study sessions!!ðŸ“šðŸ“š


Haydio is gesture controlled radio web app which detects hand gestures to turn on and off the radio whenever needed. I am currently working on improving the model made using Deep Neural Networks which is provided by TensorFlow with some hyperparameter tuning and such.Later on, I will also come up with features like volume up/down changing the radio station and such.It is made using custom HTML,CSS and Vanilla Javascript and for the Machine Learning Model, I am using the Handtrack.js library by TensorFlow which allows me to use the model for Hand Recognition.
